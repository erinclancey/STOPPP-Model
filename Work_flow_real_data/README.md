Zoonotic pathogens pose a significant risk to human health, with spillover into human populations contributing to chronic disease, sporadic epidemics, and occasional pandemics. Despite the widely recognized burden of zoonotic spillover, our ability to identify which animal populations serve as primary reservoirs for these pathogens remains incomplete. This challenge is compounded when prevalence reaches detectable levels only at specific times of year. In these cases, statistical models designed to predict the timing of peak prevalence could guide field sampling for active infections. Here we develop a general model that leverages routinely collected serosurveillance data to optimize sampling for elusive pathogens by predicting time windows of peak prevalence. Using simulated data sets, we show that our methodology reliably identifies times when pathogen prevalence is expected to peak. Then we demonstrate an implementation of our method using publicly available data from two putative \textit{Ebolavirus} reservoirs, straw-colored fruit bats (\textit{Eidolon helvum}) and hammer-headed bats (\textit{Hypsignathus monstrosus}). We envision our method being used to guide the planning of field sampling to maximize the probability of detecting active infections, and in cases when longitudinal data is available, our method can also yield predictions for the times of year that are most likely to produce future spillover events. The generality and simplicity of our methodology make it broadly applicable to a wide range of putative reservoir species where seasonal patterns of birth lead to predictable, but potentially short-lived, pulses of pathogen prevalence.

## DATA & CODE FILE OVERVIEW
The repository is split into four subdirectoires: 
1. **E_helvum_cam** - This directory contains information to follow a workflow as a demonstration of how to implement our methodology. This directory contains a README.md file explaing the workflow and two folders containing data and R code for the *E. helvum* and *H. monstrosus* populations.
2. **H_monstrosus_cam** - This directory contains the Mathematica Notebook.
