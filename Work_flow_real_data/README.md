# Workflow for the STOPPP model with real d ata

## GENERAL INFORMATION
Workflow to demonstrate an implementation of the STOPPP model with previously published sersurveillance data. Each folder contains the same files specific to each species. Data and R code in each file will re-create the analyses and figures presented in Clancey et al. "Using serosurveys to optimize surveillance for zoonotic pathogens." 

## DATA & CODE FILE OVERVIEW
The repository is split into four subdirectoires: 
1. **E_helvum_cam** - This directory contains information to follow a workflow as a demonstration of how to implement our methodology. This directory contains a README.md file explaing the workflow and two folders containing data and R code for the *E. helvum* and *H. monstrosus* populations.
2. **H_monstrosus_cam** - This directory contains the Mathematica Notebook.
